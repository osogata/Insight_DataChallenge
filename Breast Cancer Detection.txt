Breast Cancer Detection
	

You belong to the data team at a local research hospital. You've been tasked with developing a means to help doctors diagnose breast cancer. You've been given data about biopsied breast cells; where it is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous).


* What features of a cell are the largest drivers of malignancy? Build a model that predicts whether a given biopsied breast cell is benign or malignant.
* What features drive your false positive rate for your model you derived above, what features drive your false negative rate? 
* How would a physician use your product?
* There is a non-zero cost in time and money to collect each feature about a given cell. How would you go about determining the most cost-effective method of detecting malignancy?


In addition to well-documented, extendable, and reusable code we are looking for a coherent data-story. This is a deliberately open-ended question that provides a chance to showcase your EDA, analysis, and presentation skills. The expectation is that you should spend no more than 4 hours on this task, and no more than 1 one preparing a presentation.
